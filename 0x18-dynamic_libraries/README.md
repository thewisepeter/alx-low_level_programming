0x18. C - Dynamic libraries

Dynamic libraries in Linux/C, also known as shared libraries, are separate files containing compiled code that can be loaded and linked with a program at runtime. Dynamic libraries allow multiple programs to share the same code, reducing redundancy and improving efficiency. Shared libraries have the advantage of being dynamically linked, meaning that the library code is loaded into memory only when needed by a program. This allows for efficient memory usage and the ability to update or replace shared libraries without recompiling the entire program. Dynamic libraries in Linux/C are denoted by the .so (shared object) extension. They are managed by the dynamic linker/loader, which resolves symbols and handles the runtime linking process.
