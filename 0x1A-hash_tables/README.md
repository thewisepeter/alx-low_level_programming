0x1A. C - Hash tables

A hash table in C/C++ is a data structure that maps keys to values. A hash table uses a hash function to compute indexes for a key. You can store the value at the appropriate location based on the hash table index.

The benefit of using a hash table is its very fast access time. Typically, the time complexity (amortized time complexity) is a constant O(1) access time.
