Singly linked lists

A linked list is a sequence of data structures, which are connected together via links. Linked List is a sequence of links which contains items. Each link contains a connection to another link. Linked list is the second most-used data structure after array.

Arrays have a couple of issues, which linked lists can solve. for instance, deleting items in an array isnt so easy. Arrays also are of a fixed size, which can be limiting.

In this project, we learn about linked lists and their usage.
